## Contributing to **Carch** 

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to **Carch**! Contributions of all kinds are welcome, whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation. Follow this guide to get started.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Before making any contributions**, first open an issue in the **[Feature Request](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/issues/new?template=feature-reqests.yml)** section. We will discuss the changes there before proceeding with implementation. 

## 📌 Understand the Codebase

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First, **analyze how the script works** before making any changes. If you want to improve or add to the project, make sure you **understand the structure** and how each piece interacts. This will help you contribute in a way that is consistent with the project's design. 
>
> ```md
> For committing, follow the conventional commit style:
> feat: your-commit-message or fix: your-commit-message.
> ```
>
> Btw, before committing:
> - If changing any `.sh` script file, make sure they are formatted by [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) and pass [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
> - When updating `desc.toml` (scripts or descriptions), run `cargo xtask ogen` to refresh `docs/overview.md`
> - For changes to any part of the Rust files, run `cargo xtask ci` to check formatting and other validations
> - If introducing a new function that directly touches the Carch core codebase, you must write unit tests for it. Simple changes that do not affect the core logic are exempt from this requirement.
>
> Ensure you do not push directly without verifying that there are no errors anywhere.

> For more information about Conventional Commits, prefer this [guide](https://gist.github.com/harilvfs/53cc86aa79ea4642356540aadc6bd87d).

## 📚 Contributing to Carch Docs

#### **Carch Docs** is ➥ [Live Here](https://github.com/carch-org/docs)  

### 🚀 Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- 🪛 Fixing typos or mistakes in existing guides  
- 🌐 Translating the documentation into other languages (**highly encouraged!**)  

### 🌍 Translating Documentation

#### Want to help make Carch accessible to users worldwide? Help us translate the docs!

If you're contributing a **new language**, follow these steps:

1. 📁 Create a new folder for your language inside the `docs/` directory. Use [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. `fr`, `es`, `hi`, etc.).  
2. 🛠️ Translate the Markdown content inside the new folder.  
3. 🧩 Modify `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`:  
   - Add your language in the `locales` section.  
   - Provide a `label`, `lang`, and `link` for navigation.  

### 🧪 Testing Your Changes Locally

To preview your changes:

```sh
bun install
bun run docs:dev
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please open an issue first if you plan to introduce major structural or organizational changes. We’d love to discuss and collaborate on it beforehand!

### 🧾 Commit Style

Use clear commit messages like:

```sh
git commit -m "fix(docs): correct typo in installation guide"
git commit -m "feat(docs): add Hindi translation"
```
