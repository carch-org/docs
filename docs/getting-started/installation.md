<img src="https://img.shields.io/crates/v/carch?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&color=f5a97f&logoColor=fe640b&labelColor=171b22" >

Carch is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/carch).

If you want to install Carch on your Arch or Fedora system, you can use the Cargo [crate](https://crates.io/crates/carch).

First, install dependencies: 

:::code-group

```sh [<i class="devicon-archlinux-plain"></i> Arch]
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm fzf cargo rust
```

```sh [<i class="devicon-fedora-plain"></i> Fedora]
sudo dnf install fzf cargo rust -y
```
:::

Now, install Carch using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install carch
```

Once installed, simply type `carch` in your terminal to run it.

:::tip :bulb: TIP
If `carch` doesn‚Äôt run, add Cargo‚Äôs bin directory to your PATH:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Manual Installation

### üìú Dependencies

:::code-group

```sh [<i class="devicon-archlinux-plain"></i> Arch]
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm rust man-db man git wget noto-fonts-emoji curl bash-completion ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd cargo fzf glibc gcc
```

```sh [<i class="devicon-fedora-plain"></i> Fedora]
sudo dnf install rust man-db man git wget google-noto-color-emoji-fonts google-noto-emoji-fonts jetbrains-mono-fonts-all bash-completion-devel curl cargo fzf glibc gcc -y
```

### üîß Clone and Build

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/harilvfs/carch
cd carch
cargo build --release
cd target/release/
sudo cp -r carch /usr/bin/ 
```

Now you can run `carch` in your terminal. If you encounter any issues on Fedora, they might be dependency-related. The installation should work smoothly, but if any problems arise, please open an [issue](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/issues) or email me at **harilvfs@chalisehari.com.np**.
