# ðŸ”¥ Inspiration

- **[ChrisTitusTech `linutil`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/)**  

*I have a good habit of exploring new things and trying out different ideas, whether itâ€™s scripting or Linux-related tasks. Often, I find myself diving into scripting projects or experimenting with tools, even if it starts with just sitting around and tinkering.*

One of my inspirations has been watching Chris Titus Tech's [live streams](https://www.youtube.com/@TitusTechTalk) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech). Chris has been working on an amazing project called [`linutil`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/). It gave me the idea to start building my own project, but in my own unique way. Initially, my project was quite basicâ€”just a script with a `whiptail`-based TUI. It felt somewhat boring and clunky at the time.

ðŸ’¡ Later, I discovered that we could use `fzf` in Bash scripts. Before this, I was using `gum`, taking inspiration from [ml4w](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork). However, I recently **completely replaced** `gum` with `fzf`, and it has been working insanely well! ðŸ”¥  

I will always be a **gum lover** ðŸ’–, but `fzf` provides better **sustainability** for the Carch script, as well as the main menu. So, I went all in and implemented `fzf` everywhere in Carch!
